Made using COVID-19 John Hopkins API 
[source = "https://github.com/mathdroid/covid19"]

Populated the values from the API into cards indicating "Recovered","Infected","Deaths" along with a visualization on a global-scale via line chart & country-wise by bar charts.

Tasks left to be done : 

[ ] Populated the values into a visualization of a globe by d3.js


[ ] Fix Card CSS Structure by making it wider


[ ]  Deploy
